Compilation problem on GCC 4.3.2 (Debian lenny):

int32_t, int16_t, int_least32_t and friends are found in the std namespace
because stdint.h is included indirectly. They conflict with the versions
defined in the anonymous namespace.

Quick fix: comment out the local declarations of those types.


Compilation problem on GCC 4.0.? Darwin (Mac OS X 10.5.?):

In addition to the previous bug, problem with ambiguous overload of operator==
for streampos.

Quick fix: convert -1 and streamsize to streampos explicitly.
